## CONCERNS / NOTES

1. **Higher Price Point**: At €3,376-€3,907 for 2 guests, this is more expensive than Sunrise Arabian (€1,620) and White Hills (€2,147).

2. **No Lockable Door Mentioned**: Unlike Sunrise Arabian, the description doesn't explicitly mention a lockable door between bedrooms. However, with explicitly labeled "Bedroom 1" and "Bedroom 2", true separation is implied.

3. **Half-Board Option**: Offers "Breakfast & dinner" option at €3,376, which is between breakfast-only and All-Inclusive.

4. **Villa Options**: Has multiple villa options with private pools for those with higher budgets.

## FINAL VERDICT

**✅ VERIFIED: Royal Savoy Two-Bedroom Suite is a TRUE 2-bedroom option with separate sleeping areas.**

The listing explicitly shows "Bedroom 1" and "Bedroom 2" as separate rooms, confirming true 2-bedroom configuration. This is a luxury 5-star option with private beach access.

**RECOMMENDATION**: Best for those wanting luxury 5-star experience with private beach. However, for best value, Sunrise Arabian Family Suite (€1,620) offers similar 2BR configuration at less than half the price.
