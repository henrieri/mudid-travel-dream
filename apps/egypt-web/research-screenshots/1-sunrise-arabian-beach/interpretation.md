## CONCERNS / NOTES

1. **Bed Configuration Discrepancy**: The header says "2 twin beds and 1 king bed" but the description mentions "2 double beds" in the second bedroom. This may be a flexible configuration.

2. **Only All-Inclusive Available**: The Family Suite only offers All-Inclusive pricing, no breakfast-only option.

3. **Price Variation**: Regular price is €1,800, but with Genius discount (10%) it's €1,620. The actual savings is €180.

4. **Limited Availability**: Only 4 rooms left as of verification.

## FINAL VERDICT

**✅ VERIFIED: Sunrise Arabian Beach Family Suite is a TRUE 2-bedroom option with snoring isolation.**

The description explicitly states the second bedroom is "separated by a lockable door" which meets Henri's requirement for snoring isolation.

**RECOMMENDATION**: This is the **BEST VALUE** 2-bedroom All-Inclusive option at €1,620-€1,800 for 7 nights.
