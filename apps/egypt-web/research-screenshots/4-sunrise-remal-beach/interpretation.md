## FINAL VERDICT

**✅ VERIFIED: Sunrise Remal Beach Resort Family Suite is a TRUE 2-bedroom option with separate sleeping areas.**

The listing explicitly shows "Bedroom 1" and "Bedroom 2" as separate rooms with "2 bedrooms" mentioned in the description. This is a mid-range option at €2,391 All-Inclusive with the largest suite size (75m²) among verified properties.

**NOTE**: This is NOT the originally intended "Melia Sinai" - the URL redirected. Will need to find actual Melia Sinai separately.
