## CONCERNS / NOTES

1. **Not Beachfront**: Property is 950m from beach (not directly on beach like Sunrise Arabian)

2. **Breakfast Option Available**: Unlike Sunrise Arabian, White Hills offers both breakfast-only and All-Inclusive options for the Family Suite.

3. **Single Bathroom**: The suite has only 1 bathroom for both bedrooms.

4. **Clear Bedroom Separation**: The explicit labeling of "Bedroom 1" and "Bedroom 2" provides strong evidence of true separation.

## FINAL VERDICT

**✅ VERIFIED: White Hills Resort Family Suite is a TRUE 2-bedroom option with separate sleeping areas.**

The listing explicitly shows "Bedroom 1" and "Bedroom 2" as separate rooms, confirming true 2-bedroom configuration.

**RECOMMENDATION**: Good option at €2,147 All-Inclusive, but Sunrise Arabian offers better value (€1,620) and is beachfront.
