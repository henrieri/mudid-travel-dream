# Property Verification: Sunrise Diamond Beach Resort

## Verification Date: 2026-01-18

## SUMMARY

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Property** | Sunrise Diamond Beach Resort -Grand Select |
| **Status** | **NO 2BR OPTIONS** |

## Room Analysis

Available rooms:
- Superior/Deluxe rooms (€1,310-€2,113)
- Family Room with bunk bed (€1,500-€2,113) - same room
- Family Suite (€1,986-€4,308) - living room + bedroom, not 2BR
- Jacuzzi/Swim-Up Suites (€2,225-€3,795)
- Presidential Suite (€6,943) - 1BR
- Royal Villa (€15,093) - 1BR with private pool

## Analysis

Despite having expensive suites and even a Royal Villa, NONE have 2 separate bedrooms. The Family Suite has a "second room" that's a living room with sofa beds, not a proper bedroom.

## VERDICT

**NO SEPARATE BEDROOMS** - Even the €15,093 Royal Villa only has 1 bedroom. Not suitable for snoring isolation.
