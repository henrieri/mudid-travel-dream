# Snoring Solutions - Separate Sleeping Arrangements

**Problem**: Henri snores, Evelina needs quiet sleep

## Solution Options Found

### Option 1: Twin Beds in Same Room (Easiest)
Most rooms at top hotels offer **"2 twin beds"** option instead of 1 queen.

**At Pickalbatros Royal Grand:**
- Superior Double or Twin Room - can select 2 twin beds
- Elite Sea Front Room - can select 2 twin beds
- Superior Room with Pool View - can select 2 twin beds
- All rooms are 45 m² (decent size)
- All rooms have "sofa and seating area" (extra buffer)

**Pros**: Same room, same price, simple
**Cons**: Still in same room - might still hear snoring

### Option 2: Room with Sofa Bed + Twin Beds
Some rooms have both:
- **Neverland Package Room**: "2 twin beds AND 1 queen bed" (45 m²)
  - Henri could sleep on one twin, Evelina on another
  - Or one person takes the queen, another the twin
  - More separation space

**Pros**: More sleeping surfaces, more flexibility
**Cons**: Limited availability, may cost more

---

### Option 3: Suite with Separate Living Area
Look for:
- Suites with separate bedroom + living room with sofa bed
- Henri sleeps in living room, Evelina in bedroom

Need to search specifically for suite options.

---

### Option 4: Two Adjacent Rooms (Most Expensive)
Book 2 separate rooms at same hotel:
- Can request connecting or adjacent rooms
- Complete noise separation
- Double the accommodation cost

**Cost estimate** (7 nights):
- Pickalbatros: ~€1,023 × 2 = ~€2,046
- Verginia: ~€565 × 2 = ~€1,130

### Option 5: Two Different Hotels (Creative)
- Evelina stays at nice hotel (e.g., Pickalbatros €1,023)
- Henri books cheap room nearby just for sleeping (e.g., €250-400)
- Meet for breakfast/activities at main hotel

**Pros**: Evelina gets quiet sleep, Henri has dedicated sleep spot
**Cons**: Logistics, separate bookings, less romantic

---

## Recommendation

**Best practical solution**: Book room with **2 TWIN BEDS** option
- Available at most hotels
- Same price as double room
- Separate beds = less snoring disturbance
- Room has sofa as extra buffer zone

**At booking, select**: "2 twin beds" instead of "1 queen bed"

If that's not enough separation, consider **Option 4** (two rooms at Verginia for ~€1,130 total).

## Music/Noise Clarification
- Evelina is OK with music during the day
- Just needs quiet at **night** for sleeping
- Most hotels stop entertainment by 11pm-midnight
- Request room away from entertainment area to minimize residual noise
