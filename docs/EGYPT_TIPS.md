# Egypt Tips for Henri & Evelina

**Trip**: Sharm el Sheikh, Feb 15-22, 2026 (7 nights)
**From**: Tallinn, Estonia

---

## Priority: Evelina's Quiet Sleep

### Area Recommendation
**Sharks Bay** is your best choice:
- Quietest beach area that isn't completely isolated
- No nightlife noise - just waves
- 5-7 min taxi to Naama Bay restaurants/activities
- Best snorkeling directly from hotel jetties (skip crowded boats)

**Avoid**: Naama Bay for accommodation (nightlife hub, noisy at night)

### Room Request Tips
When booking, specifically request:
- Room away from pool/entertainment area
- Higher floor (less foot traffic noise)
- Room facing the sea (not the road)
- If 2 separate bedrooms: confirm they're truly separate (not just a partition)

---

## Visa: You Don't Need One!

**Good news**: Estonian citizens get FREE entry for stays up to 15 days if staying ONLY in Sharm el Sheikh (Sinai resorts exemption).

- Just get a free entry stamp at the airport
- No eVisa needed
- No Visa on Arrival fee

**BUT**: If you want to do a **Cairo day trip**, you'll need a visa:
- Apply for eVisa online 3-7 days before (easiest)
- Or get Visa on Arrival at Cairo airport

**Recommendation**: Skip Cairo unless it's a must-see. Sharm has plenty to do, and visa-free is simpler.

## Money Matters

### Currency
- **Pay in Egyptian Pounds (EGP)** for better rates
- €1 EUR = ~50 EGP (check current rate)
- ATMs widely available
- Cards accepted at hotels/restaurants, but carry cash for tips and small vendors

### Tipping is Essential!
Everyone expects tips. Budget 10-15% extra.

| Service | Tip Amount |
|---------|------------|
| Restaurant | 10-15% (if not included) |
| Housekeeping | 10-15 EGP/day |
| Luggage porter | 5-10 EGP/bag |
| Tour guide | 10-15% of tour cost |
| Taxi | Round up or 10% |
| Snorkel boat crew | 20-50 EGP |

**Important**:
- Tip in EGP only (not EUR coins - can't exchange them)
- Get small notes at airport: 10, 20, 50 EGP
- Restaurant bills often include 22-25% tax+service already
