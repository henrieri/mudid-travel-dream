# Sharm el Sheikh Research - February 2026 Trip

**Research Date**: January 17, 2026
**Trip Dates**: February 15-22, 2026 (7 nights)
**Travelers**: Henri & Evelina (from Tallinn, Estonia)

---

## 1. Key Areas & Neighborhoods

### Naama Bay - The Main Hub
**Best for**: Nightlife, dining, shopping, walkable convenience

- Most famous and busiest part of Sharm el Sheikh
- Central hub with restaurants, bars, shops, and nightclubs
- Wide sandy beaches with bustling promenade
- Mix of hotels from budget to five-star
- Walk to everything - no taxis needed
- Endless dining options: Egyptian, Italian, Lebanese, Asian, seafood

**Considerations**:
- Can get crowded during peak seasons
- Noisy at night (not ideal for Evelina's quiet sleeping requirement)
- Best if you want action and convenience

### Sharks Bay - Best for Snorkeling
**Best for**: Snorkeling/diving directly from shore, couples, relaxation

- Known for calm waters and abundant marine life
- Pristine beaches hugged by some of the best coral reefs
- Reef sits right off hotel jetties - skip crowded boats
- Protected from wind due to rocky shoreline
- Quieter than Naama Bay - attracts nature/water sports focused visitors

**Considerations**:
- Very little outside the hotel
- No nightlife (but Naama Bay is 5-7 minutes by taxi)
- Better for underwater enthusiasts than party seekers

### Nabq Bay - Quietest Area
**Best for**: Peace and quiet, luxury, eco-tourism

- Northeast of Sharm Airport, furthest from the action
- Long stretches of beachfront luxury resorts
- Eco-friendly with mangroves and natural beauty
- Perfect for honeymooners and couples seeking seclusion
- Most peaceful environment in Sharm

**Considerations**:
- More isolated - need transport to reach Naama Bay
- Limited independent restaurants/shops

### Hadaba (Ras Um Sid)
**Best for**: Balance of quiet and accessibility

- Serene retreat on scenic cliffs overlooking the sea
- Good snorkeling spots nearby
- Quieter than Naama Bay but still accessible
- Several resorts and restaurants available

### Ras Nasrani
**Best for**: Families wanting peace, shallow swimming areas

- Quiet beaches, less crowded
- Good for those wanting proximity to diving sites

---

## 2. Quietest Areas at Night (Priority for Evelina)

Ranked from quietest to noisiest:

1. **Nabq Bay** - Quietest, most secluded, luxury resorts
2. **Sharks Bay** - Very quiet, no nightlife on-site
3. **Hadaba/Ras Um Sid** - Peaceful cliffside location
4. **Ras Nasrani** - Quiet, fewer tourists
5. **Naama Bay** - Noisiest, nightlife hub (avoid for quiet sleep)

**Recommendation**: For Evelina's quiet sleeping needs, **Sharks Bay or Nabq Bay** are ideal. Sharks Bay offers the best compromise - quiet at night but close enough to Naama Bay for daytime activities.
